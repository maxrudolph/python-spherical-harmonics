# python-spherical-harmonics
Utilities for working with spherical harmonics in python.

Routines related to spherical harmonic representations of data.
The routines here are designed to work with Thorsten Becker's .ab file format
which is used with the HC mantle circulation code.

A (small) test suite is included in ab_pack_tests.py.

Requirements:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
cartopy

(optional) Thorsten Becker's sh_syn tool (included with HC):
